# Isaac GoC MPC

## Running scripts (IsaacLab)

This repo assumes IsaacLab is installed separately and you run scripts through the provided launch wrappers. 

### With WebRTC streaming
```bash
isaaclab -p scripts/view_robot.py
```

### Headless / no streaming
```bash
isaaclab_nostream -p scripts/print_robot_names.py --headless
```

## Environment 
This repo uses .envrc to set:
- ```ISAACLAB_DIR``` (path to a pre-installed IsaacLab)
- Drake / GoC-MPC env vars
- optional livestream defaults (WebRTC)

If you don't use direnv, manually source your IsaacLab venv and export the same vars. (You can follow the IsaacLab installation below.)

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html).
  We recommend using the conda or uv installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal.

- Clone or copy this project/repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library in editable mode using:

    ```bash
    # use 'PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
    python -m pip install -e source/Isaac_GoC_MPC

- Verify that the extension is correctly installed by:

    - Listing the available tasks:

        Note: It the task name changes, it may be necessary to update the search pattern `"Template-"`
        (in the `scripts/list_envs.py` file) so that it can be listed.

        ```bash
        # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
        python scripts/list_envs.py
        ```

    - Running a task:

        ```bash
        # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
        python scripts/<RL_LIBRARY>/train.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
        ```

    - Running a task with dummy agents:

        These include dummy agents that output zero or random agents. They are useful to ensure that the environments are configured correctly.

        - Zero-action agent

            ```bash
            # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
            python scripts/zero_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
            ```
        - Random-action agent

            ```bash
            # use 'FULL_PATH_TO_isaaclab.sh|bat -p' instead of 'python' if Isaac Lab is not installed in Python venv or conda
            python scripts/random_agent.py --task=<TASK_NAME>
            ```
